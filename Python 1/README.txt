Your home assignment for Class 2, Python will be as follows

by 10:00M Saturday, 10/21/17:

 

·       In console/terminal, run command: python -c “import this”;

·       Grab the text output, and assign it to a string variable, let’s say “L” in a new python script (you can just copy-paste the text manually);

·       Take your personal email as a second string and concatenate it with L;

·       Print the length of L;

·       Print the count all the vowels in L;

·       Print each 18th symbol of the string, but do it in case opposite to the original (print A if the letter is a, print a if A etc.) adding the position of that letter in the string in format like:

o   18,

o   36E

o   54

o   72I

o   …

 

Try to avoid parenthesis during the printout, like:

o   (18, ,)

o   (36, E)

o   …
